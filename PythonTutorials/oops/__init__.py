OOPS: Object-Oriented Programming System or Object-Oriented Programming Structure.

OOPS is style/design/paradigm of writing a program based on an object

Objects: real world entities which have features and perform some functions(behaviors)

features --> variables
behaviors --> functions

We need an entity to bind these variables and functions together, but we can't have object as basic entity.

Because:
1. There can be multiple objects of same type, Ex: Blue zombies: 
    When we define objects we have to repeat the code for variables and functions every time we create a Blue zombie.
2. Objects are independent of each other: Changes made on an object should not affect others.
    Ex: When I hit a blue zombie that one should die and others should not be affected
    
If we keenly observe any object is a member of larger type/ category/ class.

We decided to first define a class consisting of features and functions.

Then using this class as blueprint/ mould to create distinct/separate objects of that class.
