a=6
b=-4

2. Binary Operator: performs operation on 2 operands. Ex: +, -, * etc.,

3. Ternary Operator: performa operation on 3 operands. Ex: conditional statements

Types of OPerators:

1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, multiplication(*), division(/), modulus (%), exponent (**), floor division(//)
2. Relational/ comparison operators: >, <, <=, >=, !=, ==
3. Assignment operator: =
4. Logical operators: and, or, not
5. Membership operators: operator checks whether any particular element is part of bigger collection
    in, not in
    Ex:
    'v' in 'vivek' --> True
    'a' not in 'vivek' --> True
6. Identity Operators: operator checks whether two elements/ variables are one and the same
    is, is not
